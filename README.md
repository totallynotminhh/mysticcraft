# MysticCraft

Yep, like the description says, "A lightweight modpack designed to be like RLCraft."
This modpack can run on almost every potato laptop (I'm not sure) manufactured after 2011. Whether you have an office laptop or a newer but not designed for gaming, you can still pretty much enjoy the modpack in 60-120 FPS if you know how to optimize your device for gaming. Developed since June 2023, originally under the name MysteryCraft, has changed over the course of a year. Welp, that is enough chit-chatting. Let's cut to the chase.

System Requirements:
CPU: A Dual core processor, 2GHz or higher
GPU: Runs fine with intergrated graphics, unless you want to play with shaders
RAM: 4GB of RAM or higher is recommended
OS: Windows 7 or higher (must be 64-bit)

Additional Note:
If you want a wiki or want to search something about modpack, just search your problem and add "RLCraft" after your question, because it is designed to be like RLCraft.

That's it for now, enjoy the modpack!

By the way, FAQs and Documentation are coming soon!
