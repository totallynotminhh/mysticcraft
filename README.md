# MysticCraft

Yep, like the description says, "A lightweight modpack designed to be like RLCraft."
This modpack can run on almost every potato laptop, even your mom's old work laptop! Whether you have an office laptop or a newer one but it is not designed for gaming, you can still pretty much enjoy the modpack in 60-120 FPS if you know how to optimize your device for gaming. Developed since November 2022, originally under the name MysteryCraft, has changed day by day. From a simple modpack intended to play with my friends to a complex and hard modpack, it is truly enjoyable to play. Although this modpack difficulty is only about 80% of RLCraft, but don't let your guard down if you don't wanna die, cuz it is still pretty darn hard.

System Requirements:
CPU: A Dual core processor, 2GHz or higher <br>
GPU: Runs fine with intergrated graphics, unless you want to play with shaders <br>
RAM: 4GB of RAM or higher is recommended <br>
OS: Windows 7 or higher (must be 64-bit) <br>

Additional Note:
If you want a wiki or want to search something about modpack, just search your problem and add "RLCraft" after your question, because it is designed to be like RLCraft.

That's it for now, enjoy the modpack!
